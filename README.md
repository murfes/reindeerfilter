# Description
This is a filter that I made for the holidays! It is made using Meta's Spark AR Studio which is a program that allows creators to make 2D and 3D filters for Instagram and Facebook.

# Usage
My filter is avalible on Instagram right now, and has had some interaction already so far. Every single account that I've tested it on has been a mutual follower so far, so the filter has shown up as one of the higher ones on the list, but if you need to search it it's listed under "Christmas Reindeer".

# Acknowledgements
This would not have been possible without several youtube videos giving the basics of Spark AR Studio. 

Firstly, Ben Marriott's Youtube tutorial showed me the basics of how the face tracker works, and the technology was used to map my image of a Raindeer's big red nose on the face.

Secondly, Spark AR's base templates also helped. I was able to base most of my filter off of the "Head Decoration" template.
